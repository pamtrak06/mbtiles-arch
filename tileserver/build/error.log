Set custom paths to these libraries and header files on the command-line or in a file called 'config.py'
    ie. $ python scons/scons.py BOOST_INCLUDES=/usr/local/include BOOST_LIBS=/usr/local/lib

Once all required dependencies are found a local 'config.py' will be saved and then install:
    $ sudo python scons/scons.py install

To view available path variables:
    $ python scons/scons.py --help or -h

To view overall SCons help options:
    $ python scons/scons.py --help-options or -H
